# CodeClauseInternship_CreditCard_Fraud_Detection
Welcome to the Credit Card Fraud Detection project repository! This project focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models to detect fraudulent transactions in credit card data. With the increasing sophistication of fraudulent activities, accurate fraud detection is crucial to safeguard financial transactions and protect users' accounts.

# Project Overview
In this project, we explore various machine learning techniques to tackle the challenge of credit card fraud detection. We employ a combination of traditional machine learning algorithms and advanced techniques to develop a robust fraud detection system. By analyzing transactional data and identifying patterns indicative of fraud, our goal is to create a model that can effectively differentiate between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.
